                <p>UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to achieve the eradication of poverty, and the reduction of inequalities and exclusion. We help countries to develop policies, leadership skills, partnering abilities, institutional capabilities and build resilience in order to sustain development results.</p>

                <div class="responsive-embed widescreen"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a4zLqIGXxbg?hl=en&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0">&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;</iframe></div>

                <p>This is a critical time for the world. At UNDP, we see this period as a huge opportunity to advance the global sustainable development agenda. In September 2015, world leaders adopted the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sdgoverview.html">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>&nbsp;to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity.&nbsp;UNDP is working to strengthen new frameworks&nbsp;for development, disaster risk reduction and climate change. We support countries' efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, or Global Goals, which will guide global development priorities through 2030.</p>
                <p>UNDP's&nbsp;<a href="http://strategicplan.undp.org/">Strategic Plan (2018-2021)</a>&nbsp;has been designed to be responsive to the wide diversity of the countries we serve. The diversity is reflected in three broad development contexts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/our-focus.html">Eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/our-focus.html">Accelerate structural transformations</a></li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/our-focus.html">Build resilience to shocks and crises</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To respond to these issues, and better focus its resources and expertise to deliver on the 2030 Agenda, UNDP has identified a set of approaches that we call our Signature Solutions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping people out of&nbsp;<b>POVERTY</b></li>
                    <li><b>GOVERNANCE</b>&nbsp;for peaceful, just, and inclusive societies</li>
                    <li>Crisis prevention and increased&nbsp;<b>RESILIENCE</b></li>
                    <li><b>ENVIRONMENT</b>: nature-based solutions for development</li>
                    <li>Clean, affordable&nbsp;<b>ENERGY</b></li>
                    <li>Women's empowerment and&nbsp;<b>GENDER</b> equality</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In all our activities, we encourage the protection of human rights and the&nbsp;empowerment of women, minorities and the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
                <p>The annual&nbsp;<a href="/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/hdr.html">Human Development Report</a>, commissioned by UNDP, focuses the global debate on key development issues, providing new measurement tools, innovative analysis and often controversial policy proposals. The global Report's analytical framework and inclusive approach carry over into regional, national and local Human Development Reports, also supported by UNDP.</p>
                <h3>UNDP and the UN development system</h3>
                <p>UNDP remains committed to working even more closely with partners across the UN system. The UNDP Administrator is the Vice-Chair of the <a href="https://undg.org/" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Group (UNSDG)</a>, which unites the funds, programmes, specialized agencies, departments and offices of the UN system that play a role in sustainable development. The Administrator also convenes the UNSDG Core Group comprised of DESA, FAO, ILO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN Women, WFP, WHO and the rotating chairs of the Regional Economic Commissions.</p>
                <p>Created by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and endorsed by the General Assembly, the UNSDG is the main UNDS internal coordination mechanism at the global level. It is instrumental in enabling action on the ground and ensuring that United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) have the support, guidance and impartial oversight required as they assist governments to deliver on the 2030 Agenda. As UNSDG Vice-Chair, the UNDP Administrator is responsible for the coordination of UNSDG operational work,&nbsp;including the elaboration of program, policy and financing instruments and guidance, the functioning of the UNSDG Strategic Results Groups, as well as day-to-day management of the Resident Coordinator system.</p>
                <p>UNDP also administers the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.uncdf.org/">UN Capital Development Fund</a>, which helps developing countries grow their economies by supplementing existing sources of capital assistance by means of grants and loans; and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.unv.org/">UN Volunteers</a>, which fields over 6,500 volunteers from 160 countries, serving with 38 UN partners in support of peace, security, human rights, humanitarian delivery and development through volunteerism worldwide.</p>
